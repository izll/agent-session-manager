> **Prefer a graphical app?** The same session manager exists as a desktop
> application — [**ASMGR Desktop**](https://github.com/izll/agent-session-manager-desktop),
> built with Wails and Svelte, with real terminals, a diff viewer, a file
> browser and mobile push notifications. The two keep their sessions separately,
> so you can run both.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A terminal multiplexer:
  - **Linux / macOS** — `tmux`
  - **Windows** — [psmux](https://github.com/psmux/psmux), a native Windows
    multiplexer that speaks tmux's command language; no WSL or MSYS2 needed.
    The Windows installer offers to install it for you where winget is
    available, which is Windows 11 and Windows 10 1809+ — Server, LTSC and
    Sandbox editions have no Store and therefore no winget, so there
    [download psmux](https://github.com/psmux/psmux/releases) and put it on
    your PATH. Set `ASMGR_TMUX` to an absolute path if you would rather point
    at tmux under WSL or Cygwin.
- At least one AI CLI tool installed:
  - [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
  - [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider)
  - [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)
  - [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/)
  - [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode)

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew tap izll/tap
brew install asmgr
```

Update:
```bash
brew upgrade asmgr
```

### Windows

Download `asmgr_<version>_windows_amd64_setup.exe` from the
[releases](https://github.com/izll/agent-session-manager/releases) and run it.
It installs per-user (no administrator prompt), puts `asmgr` on your PATH, and
offers to install psmux for you if it is missing.

Open a **new** terminal afterwards — one already running will not have picked
up the new PATH.

1. Press `r` on any session
2. Browse through previous conversations (shows last message and timestamp)
3. Select a conversation to resume or start fresh

Note: Aider and custom commands don't support session resume.

## Starting Sessions

Press `a` on any session to see start options:

- **Replace current session** (1/r): Stops the current session (if running) and starts a fresh new one
- **Start parallel session** (2/n): Prompts for a name (defaults to current session name), then creates a new instance with the same settings and starts it right below the current one in the list

This allows you to work on multiple tasks in the same project simultaneously, each with their own AI session.

## Session Groups & Favorites

Organize your sessions into collapsible groups and mark favorites:

```
⭐ Favorites ▼ [2]
   ├── ● important-project
   └── ● daily-tasks

📁 Backend ▼ [3]
   ├── ● api-server
   ├── ● database-worker
   └── ○ cache-service
📁 Frontend ▶ [2]  (collapsed)
   ● misc-session
```

### Favorites
- Press `*` to toggle favorite on any session
- Favorites appear in a special ⭐ group at the top
- Sessions also remain in their original location
- The favorites group is hidden when empty

### Groups
- Press `g` to create a new group
- Press `G` to assign the selected session to a group
- Press `→` to expand a group, `←` to collapse it
- Press `Tab` to toggle collapse/expand
- Press `e` on a group to rename it
- Press `c` on a group to change its color
- Press `d` on a group to delete it (sessions become ungrouped)

Sessions without a group appear at the bottom of the list.

## Session Notes

Add persistent notes to sessions and individual tabs:

- Press `N` (Shift+N) to open the notes editor
- When a session has multiple tabs, notes are per-tab
- Write multi-line notes (Enter for new lines)
- `Ctrl+S` to save, `Esc` to cancel, `Ctrl+D` to clear
- Notes are shown in the preview pane below the session/tab info
- Notes persist across session restarts and conversation changes

Use notes to track:
- Current task/goal for each session or tab
- Important context or decisions
- TODOs and reminders
- Handoff notes when switching between sessions

## Tabs (Multi-Window Sessions)

Each session can have multiple tabs (tmux windows) for running additional agents or terminals:

### Creating Tabs

Press `t` to create a new tab. You'll be asked to choose:

- **Agent** - Start another AI agent (Claude, Gemini, etc.) in a new tab
- **Terminal** - Open a plain shell for running commands

### Tab Features

- **Activity Tracking** - Agent tabs show activity indicators (●/○) in the tab bar
- **Persistent** - Tabs are restored when you stop/start a session
- **Stopped State** - When a tab's process exits (e.g., Ctrl+D), it shows as stopped (○) instead of disappearing
- **Per-Tab Status** - Status lines under sessions show output from each tracked tab

### Tab Navigation

```
│● main │○ terminal │● claude-2 │
```

- Press `Alt+←` or `Alt+→` to switch between tabs
- Press `[` or `]` as alternatives
- Press `Ctrl+←` or `Ctrl+→` as alternatives
- Press `Ctrl+f` to toggle tracking on the current tab

### Stop/Delete with Multiple Tabs

When you have multiple tabs:
- Press `x` (stop) → asks: stop **session** or just this **tab**?
- Press `d` (delete) → asks: delete **session** or close this **tab**?
- Press `W` for quick tab close (no confirmation)

## Split View

Compare two sessions side-by-side:

- Press `v` to toggle split view
- Press `m` to mark/pin the current session (shown in top pane)
- Press `Tab` to switch focus between panes
- Navigate with arrow keys to change the selected session (bottom pane)

The pinned session stays visible while you browse other sessions, useful for comparing outputs or referencing one session while working in another.

## Diff View

View git changes directly in the preview pane:

- Press `D` to toggle between Preview and Diff view
- Press `F` to switch between Session diff and Full diff

**Session diff** shows changes since the session was started (tracked via git HEAD at start time).
**Full diff** shows all uncommitted changes in the repository.

Use diff view to:
- Review changes made by the AI agent
- Track progress during a coding session
- Compare uncommitted changes across sessions

## Global History Search

Search across all your AI agent conversation histories with `Ctrl+F`:

```

```

### Supported Sources
- **Claude** - Searches `~/.claude/projects/` history files
- **Aider** - Searches `~/.aider.chat.history.md`
- **OpenCode** - Searches local `.opencode/opencode.db` databases
- **Terminal** - Searches `~/.bash_history` or `~/.zsh_history`

### Features
- Real-time search with debounced input
- Conversation preview in right pane
- Press `Enter` to jump directly to matching ASMGR session
- Auto-scrolls preview to first match
- Only searches within ASMGR project directories

## Fork Session

Fork a Claude conversation to create a branch point:

- Press `f` on any Claude session to fork
- Choose destination:
  - **New Tab** - Fork as a new tab in the same session
  - **New Session** - Fork as a separate session
- The forked conversation includes all previous context
- Continue in different directions from the same point

This is useful for:
- Trying alternative approaches without losing progress
- Creating checkpoints before risky changes
- Running parallel experiments from the same context

## Projects

Projects allow you to organize your sessions into separate workspaces. Each project has its own isolated session list and groups.

### Project Selector

When you start ASMGR, you'll see the project selector:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agent Session Manager              │
│             v0.7.5                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  > Backend API         [5 sessions] │
│    Frontend App        [3 sessions] │
│    DevOps Scripts      [2 sessions] │
│  ───────────────────────────────────│
│    [ ] Continue without project     │
│    [+] New Project                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Select an existing project to work with its sessions
- Choose "Continue without project" for backward-compatible default sessions
- Create a new project to start fresh

### Single Instance Lock

Only one instance of ASMGR can run per project at a time. If you try to open a project that's already open in another terminal, you'll see an error with the PID of the running instance.

### Session Import

Press `i` in the project selector to import sessions from the default (no project) session list into the selected project. This is useful when migrating from the old single-session-list mode to the new project-based organization.

## Activity Indicators

Sessions and tabs show different status indicators:

- `●` Orange - **Busy** (agent is working/generating)
- `●` Cyan - **Waiting** (waiting for user permission/input)
- `●` Gray - **Idle** (ready for new prompt)
- `○` Red - **Stopped** (session or tab not running)

Each tab in a session has its own activity indicator, shown in:
- The tab bar at the top of the preview
- Status lines under sessions (when enabled with `o`)

## Configuration

Configuration files are stored in `~/.config/agent-session-manager/`:

```
~/.config/agent-session-manager/
├── projects.json              # Project list & metadata
├── sessions.json              # Default (no project) sessions
└── projects/
    ├── backend-api/
    │   └── sessions.json      # Project-specific sessions
    └── frontend-app/
        └── sessions.json
```

### projects.json
Stores the list of projects with their names and creation dates.

### sessions.json
Stores sessions and groups:
- Session: name, path, color settings, resume ID, auto-yes, group, agent type, notes
- Group: name, collapsed state, color settings

### filters.json (optional)
Customize status line filtering for each agent. Default filters are built-in, but you can override them:

```json
{
  "claude": {
    "skip_contains": ["? for", "Context left"],
    "skip_prefixes": ["╭", "╰"],
    "min_separators": 20
  },
  "opencode": {
    "skip_contains": ["ctrl+?", "Context:"],
    "content_prefix": "┃",
    "show_contains": ["Generating"],
    "show_as": ["Generating..."]
  }
}
```
